# Taxi Booking System

A web-based taxi booking application developed using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This system allows users to book taxis while providing an admin interface for managing drivers, vehicles, and bookings. Built with XAMPP as the local server environment, this system is suitable for small to medium-sized transportation services.

## Features

- **User Registration and Role Selection**: Users can register as either customers or drivers.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can manage drivers, customers, and view and edit bookings.
- **Driver and Vehicle Management**: Track driver availability, manage vehicle details like type and fuel type.
- **Location-based Booking**: Customers can filter drivers based on their location for convenient booking.
- **Booking System**: Customers can book rides with real-time booking status updates.
- **Sorting Options**: Filter taxis based on vehicle type, fuel type, and driver characteristics.
- **Database Integration**: MySQL is used for managing data across the system reliably.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: PHP for server-side scripting and MySQL for database management.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interface and interactivity.
- **Server Setup**: XAMPP to host and run the application locally.
